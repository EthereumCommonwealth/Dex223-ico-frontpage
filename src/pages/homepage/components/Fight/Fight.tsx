              Tokens and plain ether are deposited differently to &quot;Externally Owner
              Addresses&quot; (addresses owned by humans) and to smart-contracts. Ether and ERC-223
              tokens automatically determine if the recipient of the deposit is a contract or EOA
              and decide the method of deposit accordingly. ERC-20 tokens however place the burden
              of determining the transferring method on the user. Even worse, if the ERC-20 token
              transferring method is chosen incorrectly, this results in the loss of tokens due to
              the impossibility of error handling with ERC-20 standard.
